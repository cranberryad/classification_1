The dataset has different data about poisonous and safe to eat mushrooms. I created a model
that can tell whether it is safe to eat or not. The classification threshold is high because
it is better to not eat a mushroom if it is not safe.
That is why we can see a small recall but a high precision - the exact thing we need!
